# libcloud.rest

REST interface for [Libcloud][1] which exposes all the Libcloud functionality
through a RESTful API. Currently Libcloud has a big limitation - you can only
use it with Python. REST interface allows users to leverage Libcloud 
functionality through an arbitrary language which knows how to talk HTTP.

Note: This is an Apache Google Summer of Code 2012 project.

## Deploying

By default Libcloud REST runs using gevent's WSGI handler. Gevent WSGI handler
doesn't support SSL which means that if you want to use SSL you need to use a
some kind of SSL terminator such as [stud][4].
